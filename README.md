# 3-point-Texture-Filtering-N64-Unity-Shader
Shader for Unity, reproducing the texture filtering characteristic of the Nintendo 64.

How to Use:

1 - Create an Unlit Shader Script.

2 - Copy the code from this repository into your script.

3 - In the Material settings, set the Shader to: Custom > N64TextureFiltering.

You're all set!

Note: There are two shader options available:

Normal: For standard materials.

Transparency: For materials that require alpha (transparency).

If you need transparency, use the N64TextureFilteringTransparency shader. Just copy and apply it to your material!
